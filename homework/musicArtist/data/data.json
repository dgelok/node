      "blurb": "A Fable is the 4th album by Tigran Hamasyan released in February 2011. Tigran uses traditional Armenian hymns, Armenian poetry and Armenian folk music as the basis for the tracks on the album. The album also draws influences from Jazz, Rock and Pop. Tigran in an interview said that he chose the name of the album '... because each composition tells a story ... [and] people can relate to fables because they are both simple, yet deep.' He only used his first name on this album's release, but has used his full name in subsequent albums."

      "blurb": "Pianist Tigran Hamasyan won the Thelonious Monk competition in 2006, as well as the respect of such boundary-breaking jazzmen as Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, and Brad Mehldau. Now the Armenian-born artist—who moved to L.A. with his family at age 16—returns with his fifth album. While 2011’s well-received A Fable alternated between solo piano songs and textured modern pieces, this one deftly mixes tangled beats, classical music romanticism, Eastern European folk, taunt boundary-free arrangements, and a rigorous set of piano chops. Another interesting wrinkle are the haunting chorale vocals from him and female singers; they punctuates “The Poet,” the operatic postmodernism of “Erishta,” and elsewhere. The gentle “Pagan Lullaby” lives up to its name, but it's the elegiac “Holy” that's particularly sublime. These are balanced by more visceral pieces; while “The Court Jester” starts and ends with harpsichord, it morphs with insistent, metal-like rhythms, and the intense “Pt. 2 Alternative” sounds like a sweaty rock epic. Suffice to say, Shadow Theater is one of the more broadminded jazz fusions of recent years."

      "blurb": "The Armenian-born American pianist and composer Tigran Hamasyan—winner of the 2006 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition—writes and plays music that dazzles the listener with its high-octane virtuosity. On Mockroot, Hamasyan, electric bassist Sam Minaie, and drummer Arthur Huatek whiplash through material that features odd-meter rhythms and sudden shifts. The music is often marked by traditional Armenian elements, as well as dramatic flashes of prog rock and fusion. Quieter cuts, such as “The Roads That Bring Me Closer to You” and “The Apple Orchard in Saghmosavanq,” serve as a nice contrast to the blazing speed and fury."

Two of the tracks on the album are developments of traditional Armenian melodies and all tracks have influences from Armenian folk music. Tigran also draws inspiration from Jazz and Rock music, as well as the natural landscape of Mount Ararat. This was Tigran's second album on Nonesuch Records. The album is mostly solo piano, however, there is sparing use of electronics and vocals. Tigran considers his next release, the EP For Gyumri, to be a companion work to this album."
